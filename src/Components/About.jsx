            I have spent the last 12 years in the fire service working as a professional firefighter &
            paramedic. I have always had a knack for and working with computers. In 2019 1
            started working with HTML & CSS to make some minor edits on a small business website that I
            was operating. What I thought was just a few small edits turned into a love for programming.

            <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            Fascinated with how intricate can be I was quickly drawn to learn more. I started
            learning javascript and was even more enthused with making websites interactive. I then started
            freelancing for eâ€”commerce companies on the Shopify platform. I am now spending my time
            building projects with React JS, Firebase, and learning new technologies.
